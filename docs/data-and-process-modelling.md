# Data and Process Modeling

## Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
- **Levels**:
  - Context diagram (big picture)
  - Level 0 (main processes)
  - Level 1+ (detailed processes)
- **Symbols**:
  - Circles: Processes
  - Arrows: Data flows
  - Parallel lines: Data stores
  - Rectangles: External entities

## Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- **Components**:
  - Entities (nouns)
  - Attributes (properties)
  - Relationships (verbs)
- **Cardinality**:
  - One-to-one
  - One-to-many
  - Many-to-many

## BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
- **Swimlanes**: Who does what
- **Gateways**: Decision points
- **Events**: Triggers and outcomes

## Pro Tips
- **Start simple**: Context diagram first
- **Validate**: Walk through with end users
- **Iterate**: Models evolve with understanding

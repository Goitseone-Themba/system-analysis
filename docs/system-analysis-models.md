# System Analysis Models

## Waterfall Model
- **The straight-laced cousin** of SDLC models
- **Diagram**: Straight line through phases
- **Best for**: When you have crystal-clear requirements

## V-Model
- **Waterfall with testing built in**
- **Left side**: Development phases
- **Right side**: Corresponding testing phases
- **Pro**: Catches issues early

## Incremental Model
- **"Slice the pizza" approach** - deliver system in pieces
- **Pros**: Early ROI, flexible
- **Cons**: Integration headaches

## Spiral Model
- **For risk-averse organizations**
- **Cycles through**: Planning → Risk Analysis → Development → Evaluation
- **Heavy on**: Risk management

## Prototyping Model
- **"Show me" approach**
- **Types**:
  - Throwaway (quick and dirty)
  - Evolutionary (builds toward final product)
- **Watch for**: Users getting attached to prototype UI

## OOAD (Object-Oriented Analysis and Design)
- **UML Diagrams**:
  - Class diagrams (system structure)
  - Sequence diagrams (interactions)
  - Use case diagrams (functionality)

## Logical vs Physical Models
| Aspect        | Logical Model            | Physical Model           |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Focus         | What the system does     | How it's implemented     |
| Audience      | Business analysts        | Developers               |
| Diagrams      | DFDs, ERDs               | Database schemas, network diagrams |
| Flexibility   | High                     | Low                      |
